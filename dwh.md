### Content of the Lesson

#### What is a data warehouse?

A data warehouse is a large, integrated, and subject-oriented database that stores data from various operational systems and external sources. It is designed to support decision-making processes by providing a consolidated view of data for analysis and reporting. Unlike operational databases, which are optimized for transaction processing, data warehouses are optimized for analytical processing.

Bill Inmon, known as the "Father of Data Warehousing," defines a data warehouse as follows:

"A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and non-volatile collection of data in support of management's decision-making process."

Let's break down the key characteristics mentioned in this definition:

- **Subject-oriented**: A data warehouse is organized around specific subjects or areas of interest, such as sales, marketing, or finance. It focuses on providing a comprehensive view of data related to these subjects, making it easier for users to analyze and understand data in a meaningful context.

- **Integrated**: Data from multiple sources is integrated and transformed into a common format to ensure consistency and accuracy. This integration process allows users to analyze data from different sources without worrying about data inconsistencies.

- **Time-variant**: Data warehouses maintain historical data, allowing users to analyze trends and patterns over time. The data is tagged with timestamps or date ranges to enable time-based analysis.

- **Non-volatile**: Once data is loaded into a data warehouse, it is typically not modified or deleted. The data remains stable and consistent, providing a reliable source for historical analysis and reporting.

When designing a data warehouse, organizations can choose between SQL databases (e.g., MySQL or Oracle) or NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB), depending on their specific needs and data types. Additionally, data warehouses often employ various techniques to organize and structure data in a way that facilitates efficient querying and reporting. These techniques include data modeling, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and multidimensional modeling.

### Content of the Lesson

#### Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling

Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling is a popular technique used to represent the relationships between entities in a database. In the context of data warehousing, ER modeling helps in designing the structure of the data warehouse by identifying the entities and their relationships.

An entity represents a real-world object or concept, such as a customer, product, or sales transaction. Entities have attributes that describe their characteristics. For example, a customer entity may have attributes like customer ID, name, address, and contact information.

Relationships between entities represent the associations or connections between them. There are three main types of relationships:

1. One-to-One (1:1): Each record in one entity is related to only one record in another entity.
2. One-to-Many (1:N): Each record in one entity can be related to multiple records in another entity.
3. Many-to-Many (M:N): Multiple records in one entity can be related to multiple records in another entity.

ER modeling uses special diagrammatic notations to represent entities, attributes, and relationships. The most common notation is the ER diagram, which consists of rectangles for entities, ovals for attributes, diamonds for relationships, and lines to connect entities and attributes to represent their associations.

Here's an example of an ER diagram for a simplified eLearning system:

![Example of Entity Relationship Diagram](ERD_example.png)

In this ER diagram, we have several entities such as User, Course, Module, Quiz, QuizQuestion, Enrollment, CourseInstructor, Attempt, DiscussionForum, and ForumPost. The diagram depicts the relationships between these entities, such as a User enrolls in a Course, a Course has Modules, a Module has Quizzes, and so on.

ER modeling helps in understanding the data requirements, identifying the entities and their attributes, and defining the relationships between them. It serves as a blueprint for designing the logical and physical structure of the data warehouse.

#### Star Schemas

A star schema is a popular data modeling technique used in data warehousing. It is a simplified and denormalized structure that consists of a central fact table surrounded by multiple dimension tables. The fact table contains the quantitative measures or metrics, while the dimension tables provide the context and descriptive attributes for the measures.

The star schema gets its name from its visual representation, which resembles a star with the fact table at the center and the dimension tables radiating outwards like the points of a star.

Here's an example of a star schema for a quiz attempt fact table in an eLearning system:

![Example of a Star Schema](starschema_example2.png)

In this star schema, the QuizAttemptFact table is at the center, containing the quantitative measures such as Score and TimeTaken. The fact table is linked to several dimension tables: DateDim, TimeDim, UserDim, CourseDim, QuizDim, ModuleDim, and InstructorDim.

The dimension tables provide the descriptive attributes and context for the measures in the fact table. For example:
- The DateDim table contains attributes like Date, Weekday, Month, Quarter, and Year, allowing for analysis of quiz attempts over different time periods.
- The UserDim table includes attributes such as FirstName, LastName, Email, and Role, enabling analysis of quiz attempts by user characteristics.
- The CourseDim table provides attributes like CourseName, StartDate, and EndDate, allowing for analysis of quiz attempts within specific courses.

The star schema offers several advantages for data warehousing, including simplicity, query performance, aggregation, and scalability. However, it also has some considerations, such as data redundancy, data integrity, and updates and maintenance.

#### Snowflake Schemas

A snowflake schema is an extension of the star schema, designed to further normalize the dimension tables. In a snowflake schema, the dimension tables are divided into multiple related tables, creating a hierarchical structure that resembles a snowflake.

The main difference between a star schema and a snowflake schema is that in a snowflake schema, the dimension tables are normalized to eliminate redundancy. This normalization process splits the dimension tables into smaller, related tables based on functional dependencies.

Here's an example of a snowflake schema based on a sales fact table:

![Example of a Snowflake Schema](snowflake_schema_example.png)

In this snowflake schema, the SalesFact table is at the center, linked to several dimension tables. The dimension tables are further normalized into related tables. For example:
- The Product dimension table is split into Product and Category tables.
- The Store dimension table is split into Store, City, and StoreCategory tables.

The snowflake schema offers advantages such as a normalized structure, data integrity, and flexibility. However, it also has considerations, such as query complexity, query performance, and maintenance overhead.

The choice between a star schema and a snowflake schema depends on the specific requirements of the data warehouse, the complexity of the data, and the trade-offs between simplicity, query performance, and data integrity.

#### Dimension Tables

Dimension tables are a fundamental component of data warehouse modeling. They provide the descriptive attributes and context for the measures stored in the fact table. Dimension tables are used to analyze and slice the data in different ways, enabling users to gain insights from various perspectives.

Here are some key characteristics and considerations for dimension tables:

1. Descriptive Attributes: Dimension tables contain descriptive attributes that provide context and meaning to the measures in the fact table. These attributes allow users to analyze the data based on different dimensions, such as time, geography, product, or customer.

2. Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs): Dimension tables often need to handle changes in attribute values over time. There are different techniques to manage these changes, known as Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs). The most common types are:   - Type 1 SCD: The attribute value is overwritten with the new value, losing the historical information.   - Type 2 SCD: A new row is added to the dimension table with the updated attribute value, preserving the historical information.   - Type 3 SCD: A new attribute column is added to the dimension table to capture the change, while also keeping the original attribute value.

3. Hierarchies: Dimension tables can have hierarchical relationships between attributes. For example, in a Time dimension, the hierarchy could be Day > Month > Quarter > Year. These hierarchies enable users to analyze data at different levels of granularity.

4. Surrogate Keys: Dimension tables typically use surrogate keys as the primary key. A surrogate key is an artificially generated unique identifier that is not derived from the business data. It provides a stable and efficient way to link dimension tables to the fact table.

5. Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Techniques: Dimension tables often need to handle changes in attribute values over time. There are different techniques to manage these changes, known as Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs). The most common types are:   - Type 1 SCD: The attribute value is overwritten with the new value, losing the historical information.   - Type 2 SCD: A new row is added to the dimension table with the updated attribute value, preserving the historical information.   - Type 3 SCD: A new attribute column is added to the dimension table to capture the change, while also keeping the original attribute value.

6. Dimension Table Types:   - Conformed Dimensions: Conformed dimensions are standardized dimensions that are shared across multiple fact tables. They ensure consistency and enable users to analyze data across different subject areas.   - Junk Dimensions: Junk dimensions are created to store low-cardinality attributes that don't fit well into other dimension tables. They help in reducing the number of dimensions and improving query performance.   - Degenerate Dimensions: Degenerate dimensions are dimensions that are stored in the fact table itself, usually as a combination of other dimension keys. They don't have a separate dimension table.

Dimension tables play a crucial role in enabling multidimensional analysis and providing context to the measures in the fact table. They allow users to slice and dice the data based on various attributes and hierarchies, enabling them to gain insights and make informed decisions.

#### Fact Tables

Fact tables are the central component of a data warehouse schema. They store the quantitative measures or metrics that are subject to analysis. Fact tables are typically surrounded by dimension tables, which provide the context and descriptive attributes for the measures.

Here are some key characteristics and considerations for fact tables:

1. Granularity: Fact tables store data at a specific level of granularity, which represents the level of detail captured in each row. The granularity is determined by the combination of dimension keys present in the fact table. For example, a sales fact table may have a granularity of individual sales transactions, with each row representing a specific sale.

2. Measures: Fact tables contain numeric measures that are the focus of analysis. These measures can be additive, semi-additive, or non-additive. Additive measures can be summed across all dimensions, such as sales amount. Semi-additive measures can be summed across some dimensions but not others, such as account balances. Non-additive measures cannot be summed across any dimension, such as ratios or percentages.

3. Dimension Keys: Fact tables have foreign keys that link to the primary keys of the associated dimension tables. These dimension keys provide the context for the measures and allow for slicing and dicing the data based on different dimensions.

4. Types of Fact Tables:   - Transactional Fact Tables: These fact tables capture individual transactions or events, such as sales transactions or website clicks. They have a high level of granularity and can grow large over time.   - Snapshot Fact Tables: These fact tables capture the state of measures at specific points in time, such as daily or monthly snapshots. They have a lower level of granularity compared to transactional fact tables.   - Accumulating Snapshot Fact Tables: These fact tables capture the progress of a process or lifecycle, such as order fulfillment or customer journey. They have multiple date dimensions representing key milestones in the process.

5. Additivity: Fact tables should be designed to support efficient aggregation and calculation of measures across different dimensions. Additive measures are the most common and allow for straightforward aggregation. Semi-additive and non-additive measures may require special handling or derived calculations.

6. Partitioning and Indexing: Fact tables can grow very large over time, impacting query performance. Partitioning and indexing techniques can be applied to improve query efficiency. Partitioning involves dividing the fact table into smaller, manageable chunks based on a specific dimension, such as time. Indexing helps in faster data retrieval by creating additional data structures that allow for quick lookup of specific values.

7. Summarization: Fact tables can be summarized or aggregated at different levels of granularity to improve query performance and support faster analysis. Pre-aggregated summary tables can be created to store commonly used aggregations, reducing the need for on-the-fly calculations.

Fact tables are the foundation of a data warehouse schema, holding the quantitative measures that are subject to analysis. They are designed to support efficient querying, aggregation, and calculation of measures across different dimensions. By understanding the characteristics and considerations of fact tables, data warehouse designers can create effective schemas that meet the analytical needs of the organization.

#### Conceptual, Logical, and Physical Design Process for Data Warehouses

The design process for data warehouses involves three main stages: conceptual design, logical design, and physical design. Each stage plays a crucial role in creating an effective and efficient data warehouse solution.

1. Conceptual Design:   - The conceptual design stage focuses on understanding the business requirements and defining the high-level structure of the data warehouse.   - It involves identifying the key subject areas, entities, and relationships that need to be represented in the data warehouse.   - The conceptual design is typically represented using entity-relationship (ER) diagrams or UML (Unified Modeling Language) class diagrams.   - The goal is to capture the essential business concepts and their relationships without delving into technical details.

2. Logical Design:   - The logical design stage translates the conceptual design into a more detailed representation of the data warehouse structure.   - It involves defining the tables, attributes, and relationships based on the chosen data modeling approach, such as the star schema or snowflake schema.   - The logical design also includes specifying the data types, constraints, and keys for each table.   - The focus is on creating a normalized or denormalized structure that supports efficient querying and analysis.   - The logical design is typically represented using relational database modeling techniques, such as entity-relationship diagrams or data modeling tools.

3. Physical Design:   - The physical design stage involves mapping the logical design to the actual implementation of the data warehouse on a specific database management system (DBMS).   - It considers the physical storage structures, indexes, partitioning strategies, and performance optimization techniques.   - The physical design also includes defining the data loading processes, such as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs, to populate the data warehouse with data from various sources.   - The goal is to optimize the data warehouse for query performance, data loading efficiency, and scalability.   - The physical design may involve decisions related to hardware configuration, storage layout, and data compression techniques.

Throughout the design process, it is essential to consider the business requirements, data quality, data integration, and performance objectives. The design process is iterative, and each stage may involve refinements and adjustments based on feedback and evolving requirements.

The conceptual, logical, and physical design stages provide a structured approach to designing data warehouses that meet the business needs and enable effective data analysis and reporting. By following this design process, organizations can create data warehouse solutions that are well-structured, efficient, and aligned with their business objectives.

### Content of the Lesson

#### Data Extraction from Source Systems

The initial step in the data loading process is extracting data from source systems. These source systems encompass a variety of data repositories, including databases, spreadsheets, flat files, and other data sources. The extraction process is vital for gathering the necessary data for further analysis and reporting.

Several extraction methods are employed to facilitate this process:

1. Full Extraction:
   - Full extraction involves extracting the entire dataset from the source system.
   - This approach is typically chosen when dealing with smaller datasets or when it is necessary to load the entire dataset into the data warehouse.
   - However, full extraction can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.

2. Incremental Extraction:
   - Incremental extraction involves extracting only the data changes or updates that have occurred since the last extraction.
   - This method is commonly utilized in scenarios where the source data volume is substantial, and it's not necessary to reload the entire dataset into the data warehouse each time.
   - Incremental extraction offers advantages by reducing processing time and resource requirements when compared to full extraction.

3. Delta Extraction:
   - Delta extraction is a specialized form of incremental extraction that focuses on extracting only the 'delta' or the difference between the current dataset and the one from the previous extraction.
   - This approach is particularly beneficial when the source system supports change data capture (CDC) or when real-time tracking and capture of data changes are necessary.
   - Delta extraction allows for fast loading times and places significantly less computational load on the system, making it suitable for dynamic data environments.

Here's an example of extracting data from a source system using SQL:

```sql
-- Full extraction
SELECT *
FROM source_table;

-- Incremental extraction
SELECT *
FROM source_table
WHERE last_modified_date > '2023-01-01';

-- Delta extraction
SELECT *
FROM source_table
WHERE last_modified_date > (SELECT MAX(last_modified_date) FROM target_table);
```

In this example, the full extraction query retrieves all records from the source table. The incremental extraction query retrieves records that have been modified since a specific date. The delta extraction query retrieves records that have been modified since the last extraction by comparing the maximum last_modified_date in the target table.

#### Data Transformation

After extracting data from source systems, the next crucial step is data transformation. This process is essential to ensure that the data meets the requirements of the data warehouse and is ready for analysis and reporting. Data transformation involves various operations, including cleaning, filtering, aggregating, and integrating the extracted data.

Here are some common data transformation techniques:

1. Data Cleaning:
   - Data cleaning involves identifying and rectifying errors, inconsistencies, and duplicates present in the extracted data.
   - This step is vital for maintaining data quality and integrity within the data warehouse.
   - Common cleaning tasks include eliminating invalid or missing values, standardizing data formats, and resolving conflicts that may arise from different data sources.

2. Data Filtering:
   - Data filtering focuses on selecting and extracting only the relevant subset of data from the extracted dataset.
   - This process serves the dual purpose of reducing data volume and enhancing the efficiency of the data loading process.
   - Filtering criteria can be based on specific attributes, time periods, or other pertinent factors, ensuring that only valuable data is retained for further analysis.

3. Data Aggregation:
   - Data aggregation involves summarizing or consolidating the extracted data to a higher level of granularity.
   - This step is particularly useful for reducing data volume and enhancing query performance within the data warehouse.
   - Aggregation operations can include functions like sum, average, count, or max/min, allowing for the presentation of data in a more concise and meaningful format.

4. Data Integration:
   - Data integration is the process of combining and merging data from multiple sources into a unified format.
   - This step becomes necessary when the data warehouse needs to integrate data from various systems or departments within an organization.
   - Successful integration ensures that the data is harmonized and can be used cohesively for analytical purposes.

Here's an example of data transformation using Python:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the extracted data into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('extracted_data.csv')

# Data cleaning
df.dropna(inplace=True)  # Remove rows with missing values
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])  # Convert date column to datetime format

# Data filtering
filtered_df = df[(df['sales'] > 1000) & (df['date'] >= '2023-01-01')]

# Data aggregation
aggregated_df = filtered_df.groupby(['product', 'region']).agg({
    'sales': 'sum',
    'quantity': 'sum'
})

# Data integration
integrated_df = pd.merge(aggregated_df, product_master_df, on='product')

# Save the transformed data to a new file
integrated_df.to_csv('transformed_data.csv', index=False)
```

In this example, the extracted data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. Data cleaning is performed by removing rows with missing values and converting the date column to the appropriate datetime format. Data filtering is applied to select only rows where sales are greater than 1000 and the date is on or after January 1, 2023.

Data aggregation is achieved using the `groupby` function to calculate the sum of sales and quantity for each product and region combination. Finally, data integration is performed by merging the aggregated data with a product master DataFrame based on the product column.

#### Loading Data into the Data Warehouse

After the data is extracted and transformed, it is ready to be loaded into the data warehouse. The loading process involves inserting the transformed data into the appropriate tables or structures in the data warehouse.

There are several loading methods, including:

1. Batch Loading:
   - Batch loading involves loading a large volume of data in batches or groups.
   - This method is suitable for scenarios where the data can be processed offline or during non-peak hours.
   - Batch loading is efficient for handling large datasets but may introduce a delay between data extraction and availability in the data warehouse.

2. Trickle Loading:
   - Trickle loading involves continuously loading small amounts of data in real-time or near real-time.
   - This method is useful when the data needs to be available immediately or when the data volume is relatively small.
   - Trickle loading ensures a more up-to-date data warehouse but may require additional resources to handle the continuous data flow.

3. Real-time Loading:
   - Real-time loading involves loading data as soon as it becomes available in the source systems.
   - This method is suitable for scenarios where the data needs to be analyzed or reported in real-time.
   - Real-time loading requires a robust and efficient data integration and loading infrastructure to handle the continuous data flow.
   - It is especially beneficial in industries such as finance, telecommunications, and online retail, where up-to-the-second data is crucial for decision-making and staying competitive.

Here's an example of loading transformed data into a data warehouse using SQL:

```sql
-- Create the target table in the data warehouse
CREATE TABLE sales_fact (
    product_key INT,
    region_key INT,
    date_key INT,
    sales DECIMAL(10, 2),
    quantity INT
);

-- Load the transformed data into the target table
INSERT INTO sales_fact (product_key, region_key, date_key, sales, quantity)
SELECT p.product_key, r.region_key, d.date_key, t.sales, t.quantity
FROM transformed_data t
JOIN product_dim p ON t.product = p.product_name
JOIN region_dim r ON t.region = r.region_name
JOIN date_dim d ON t.date = d.date;
```

In this example, a target table named `sales_fact` is created in the data warehouse to store the sales data. The transformed data is then loaded into the target table using an `INSERT INTO` statement.

The transformed data is joined with the dimension tables (`product_dim`, `region_dim`, and `date_dim`) based on the respective attributes to retrieve the corresponding surrogate keys. The surrogate keys are used to establish the relationships between the fact table and the dimension tables in the data warehouse.

#### Data Quality Considerations

Data quality is a critical aspect of the data loading process. Poor data quality can lead to inaccurate analysis, unreliable reports, and incorrect business decisions. It is essential to ensure data quality throughout the entire data loading process, from extraction to loading.

Here are some key data quality considerations:

1. Data Accuracy:
   - Data accuracy refers to the correctness and precision of the data.
   - It is important to validate and verify the extracted and transformed data to ensure its accuracy.
   - Data accuracy can be improved through data cleansing, validation rules, and data profiling techniques.

2. Data Completeness:
   - Data completeness refers to the presence of all required data elements in the data warehouse.
   - It is crucial to ensure that all relevant data is extracted and loaded into the data warehouse.
   - Data completeness can be achieved through data profiling, data validation, and data reconciliation techniques.

3. Data Consistency:
   - Data consistency refers to the uniformity and coherence of the data across different sources and systems.
   - It is important to reconcile and resolve any inconsistencies or conflicts in the extracted and transformed data.
   - Data consistency can be ensured through data integration, data mapping, and data reconciliation techniques.

4. Data Timeliness:
   - Data timeliness refers to the currency and freshness of the data in the data warehouse.
   - It is important to minimize the delay between data extraction and loading to ensure timely availability of data for analysis and reporting.
   - Data timeliness can be improved through real-time or near real-time loading methods.

5. Data Validity:
   - Data validity refers to the conformity and adherence of the data to predefined rules and constraints.
   - It is important to validate and enforce data integrity rules during the data loading process.
   - Data validity can be ensured through data validation, data profiling, and data quality monitoring techniques.

Here's an example of implementing data quality checks using Python:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the transformed data into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('transformed_data.csv')

# Check for missing values
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
print("Missing values:")
print(missing_values)

# Check for duplicate records
duplicate_records = df.duplicated().sum()
print(f"Number of duplicate records: {duplicate_records}")

# Check for data consistency
region_codes = ['NA', 'EU', 'APAC']
invalid_regions = df[~df['region'].isin(region_codes)]
print("Invalid region codes:")
print(invalid_regions)

# Check for data validity
invalid_dates = df[pd.to_datetime(df['date'], errors='coerce').isnull()]
print("Invalid date values:")
print(invalid_dates)
```

In this example, the transformed data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. Several data quality checks are performed:

- Missing values are identified by counting the number of null values in each column.
- Duplicate records are detected using the `duplicated()` function.
- Data consistency is checked by verifying that the region codes are valid based on a predefined list.
- Data validity is checked by attempting to convert the date column to a datetime format and identifying any invalid date values.

The results of these data quality checks are printed, allowing for the identification and resolution of any data quality issues before loading the data into the data warehouse.

#### ETL vs. ELT

![ETL vs ELT Comparison](ETLandELTRedshift1.jpg "ETL and ELT Process")

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) are two approaches to the data loading process in data warehousing. The main difference between the two approaches lies in the order of the transformation step.

ETL Approach:
- In the ETL approach, data is first extracted from the source systems, then transformed to meet the requirements of the data warehouse, and finally loaded into the data warehouse.
- The transformation step occurs before the data is loaded into the data warehouse.
- ETL is suitable for scenarios where data transformation is complex and resource-intensive.
- ETL allows for data cleansing, integration, and restructuring before loading, ensuring that the data is in the desired format and quality.
- However, ETL can be slower and less scalable compared to ELT, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.

ELT Approach:
- In the ELT approach, data is first extracted from the source systems and loaded into the data warehouse without significant transformation.
- The transformation step occurs within the data warehouse, typically using SQL or other query languages.
- ELT is suitable for scenarios where data transformation can be efficiently performed within the data warehouse.
- ELT allows for faster loading of raw data into the data warehouse, enabling quicker access to the data for analysis.
- However, ELT may require more storage space in the data warehouse to accommodate the raw data, and the transformation process may put additional load on the data warehouse infrastructure.

The choice between ETL and ELT depends on various factors, including the complexity of data transformation, the volume of data, the available resources, and the specific requirements of the data warehouse.

Here's an example of an ETL process using Python and SQL:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Extract data from source systems
source_data = pd.read_csv('source_data.csv')

# Transform data
transformed_data = source_data.rename(columns={'old_name': 'new_name'})
transformed_data['created_date'] = pd.to_datetime(transformed_data['created_date'])
transformed_data = transformed_data[transformed_data['sales'] > 0]

# Load data into the data warehouse
engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@host/database')
transformed_data.to_sql('sales_fact', engine, if_exists='append', index=False)
```

In this example, the ETL process is implemented using Python and SQL. The source data is extracted from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. The data is then transformed by renaming columns, converting the created_date column to a datetime format, and filtering out rows with non-positive sales values.

Finally, the transformed data is loaded into the data warehouse using SQLAlchemy to connect to a PostgreSQL database. The `to_sql()` function is used to load the data into the `sales_fact` table, with the `if_exists` parameter set to 'append' to add the data to the existing table.

Here's an example of an ELT process using SQL:

```sql
-- Extract data from source systems
CREATE TABLE raw_sales_data AS
SELECT *
FROM source_database.sales;

-- Load data into the data warehouse
CREATE TABLE sales_fact AS
SELECT *
FROM raw_sales_data;

-- Transform data within the data warehouse
UPDATE sales_fact
SET created_date = TO_DATE(created_date, 'YYYY-MM-DD');

DELETE FROM sales_fact
WHERE sales <= 0;
```

In this example, the ELT process is implemented using SQL. The source data is extracted from a source database table into a new table called `raw_sales_data` in the data warehouse. The data is then loaded into the `sales_fact` table without any transformations.

The transformation step is performed within the data warehouse using SQL statements. The `created_date` column is converted to a date format using the `TO_DATE()` function, and rows with non-positive sales values are deleted using a `DELETE` statement.

#### Extraction, Cleaning, and Storage Techniques for Business Data

Extracting, cleaning, and storing business data is a crucial aspect of the data loading process in data warehousing. It involves retrieving data from various source systems, ensuring its quality and consistency, and loading it into the data warehouse for analysis and reporting. Let's explore each of these techniques in more detail.

1. Data Extraction:
   - Data extraction is the process of retrieving data from source systems, such as transactional databases, CRM systems, or flat files.
   - There are different approaches to data extraction, including full extraction, incremental extraction, and change data capture (CDC).
   - Full extraction involves extracting the entire dataset from the source system, while incremental extraction focuses on extracting only the changes or updates since the last extraction.
   - CDC captures and extracts data changes in real-time or near real-time, enabling up-to-date data in the data warehouse.
   - Extraction techniques may involve using SQL queries, APIs, or specialized ETL tools to retrieve the data from the source systems.

2. Data Cleaning:
   - Data cleaning, also known as data cleansing or data scrubbing, is the process of identifying and correcting inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistent data.
   - It involves various techniques to ensure data quality, such as data profiling, data validation, data standardization, data deduplication, and data enrichment.
   - Data profiling helps in analyzing the data to identify patterns, anomalies, and quality issues.
   - Data validation checks the data against predefined rules or constraints to identify invalid or inconsistent values.
   - Data standardization converts data into a consistent format, such as standardizing date formats or address structures.
   - Data deduplication identifies and removes duplicate records or merges them into a single record.
   - Data enrichment enhances the data with additional information from external sources to improve its completeness and accuracy.
   - Data cleaning is essential to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of the data in the data warehouse, enabling accurate analysis and decision-making.

3. Data Storage:
   - Data storage involves loading and storing the extracted and cleaned data in the data warehouse.
   - The storage techniques used in data warehousing are designed to optimize query performance and support efficient data retrieval.
   - Common storage techniques include relational databases, columnar databases, data partitioning, data compression, and data indexing.
   - Relational databases store data in tables and schemas, providing a structured and widely used approach to data storage.
   - Columnar databases store data in a columnar format, optimizing query performance for analytical workloads.
   - Data partitioning involves splitting large tables into smaller, more manageable partitions based on certain criteria, such as date ranges or geographic regions.
   - Data compression reduces the storage footprint and improves query performance by applying compression techniques to the data.
   - Data indexing creates additional data structures to speed up data retrieval and query execution.
   - The choice of storage techniques depends on factors such as data volume, query patterns, and performance requirements.

Here's an example of extracting, cleaning, and storing business data using Python and SQL:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Extract data from source systems
source_data = pd.read_csv('source_data.csv')

# Data cleaning
# Remove rows with missing values
cleaned_data = source_data.dropna()

# Standardize date format
cleaned_data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(cleaned_data['date'], format='%Y-%m-%d')

# Deduplicate data
cleaned_data = cleaned_data.drop_duplicates(subset=['id'])

# Data enrichment
enriched_data = pd.merge(cleaned_data, external_data, on='key')

# Store data in the data warehouse
engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@host/database')
enriched_data.to_sql('fact_table', engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)
```

In this example, the data is extracted from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. Data cleaning techniques are applied, such as removing rows with missing values, standardizing the date format, and deduplicating the data based on the 'id' column.

Data enrichment is performed by merging the cleaned data with an external dataset based on a common key. This step enhances the data with additional information from the external source.

Finally, the enriched data is stored in the data warehouse using SQLAlchemy to connect to a PostgreSQL database. The `to_sql()` function is used to load the data into the `fact_table`, with the `if_exists` parameter set to 'replace' to overwrite any existing data in the table.

Here's an example of creating partitions and indexes in SQL to optimize data storage and retrieval:

```sql
-- Create partitions based on date ranges
CREATE TABLE sales_fact_partitioned (
    id INT,
    date DATE,
    product_id INT,
    sales DECIMAL(10, 2)
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (date);

CREATE TABLE sales_fact_2022_01 PARTITION OF sales_fact_partitioned
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2022-01-01') TO ('2022-02-01');

CREATE TABLE sales_fact_2022_02 PARTITION OF sales_fact_partitioned
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2022-02-01') TO ('2022-03-01');

-- Create indexes on frequently accessed columns
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_fact_date ON sales_fact_partitioned (date);
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_fact_product_id ON sales_fact_partitioned (product_id);
```

In this example, partitions are created for the `sales_fact_partitioned` table based on date ranges. The table is partitioned by the `date` column, and separate partition tables (`sales_fact_2022_01` and `sales_fact_2022_02`) are created for each month.

Indexes are created on the `date` and `product_id` columns to speed up query performance. These indexes help in quickly locating and retrieving specific data records without scanning the entire table.

Extracting, cleaning, and storing business data is an iterative process that requires close collaboration between data engineers, data analysts, and business stakeholders. It involves understanding the data requirements, defining data quality rules, and establishing data governance practices to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the data in the data warehouse.

By applying effective extraction, cleaning, and storage techniques, organizations can ensure that their data warehouse contains high-quality, reliable data that can be used for accurate analysis, reporting, and decision-making.

### Content of the Lesson

#### OLAP Cubes

OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) cubes are multidimensional structures that allow for efficient data analysis. They form the core of most OLAP systems and provide a way to organize and summarize large amounts of data into a format that is easy to understand and navigate.

An OLAP cube is a data structure that consists of measures and dimensions. Measures are the quantitative values that are being analyzed, such as sales revenue or units sold. Dimensions are the attributes or characteristics that provide context to the measures, such as time, product, or location.

The cube metaphor comes from the fact that an OLAP cube can be visualized as a multidimensional cube, with each dimension representing a different aspect of the data. For example, a sales cube might have dimensions for time, product, and location, with the measures being sales revenue and units sold.

OLAP cubes allow users to perform various analytical operations, such as slicing and dicing the data, drilling down to more detailed levels, or rolling up to higher levels of aggregation. These operations enable users to explore the data from different perspectives and gain insights into patterns, trends, and anomalies.

Here's an example of a simple OLAP cube in Python using the `pandas` library:
