*Data Extraction from Source Systems*

The initial step in the data loading process is extracting data from source systems. These source systems encompass a variety of data repositories, including databases, spreadsheets, flat files, and other data sources. The extraction process is vital for gathering the necessary data for further analysis and reporting.

Several extraction methods are employed to facilitate this process:

1. Full Extraction:
- Full extraction involves extracting the entire dataset from the source system.
- This approach is typically chosen when dealing with smaller datasets or when it is necessary to load the entire dataset into the data warehouse.
- However, full extraction can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.
2. Incremental Extraction:
- Incremental extraction involves extracting only the data changes or updates that have occurred since the last extraction.
- This method is commonly utilized in scenarios where the source data volume is substantial, and it’s not necessary to reload the entire dataset into the data warehouse each time.
- Incremental extraction offers advantages by reducing processing time and resource requirements when compared to full extraction.
3. Delta Extraction:
- Delta extraction is a specialized form of incremental extraction that focuses on extracting only the ‘delta’ or the difference between the current dataset and the one from the previous extraction.
- This approach is particularly beneficial when the source system supports change data capture (CDC) or when real-time tracking and capture of data changes are necessary.
- Delta extraction allows for fast loading times and places significantly less computational load on the system, making it suitable for dynamic data environments.

Here’s an example of extracting data from a source system using SQL:

*-- Full extraction* **SELECT** \*

**FROM** source\_table;

*-- Incremental extraction*

**SELECT** \*

**FROM** source\_table

**WHERE** last\_modified\_date > '2023-01-01';

*-- Delta extraction*

**SELECT** \*

**FROM** source\_table

**WHERE** last\_modified\_date > (**SELECT** MAX(last\_modified\_date) **FROM** target\_table);

In this example, the full extraction query retrieves all records from the source table. The incremental extraction query retrieves records that have been modified since a specific date. The delta extraction query retrieves records that have been modified since the last extraction by comparing the maximum last\_modified\_date in the target table.

*Data Transformation*

After extracting data from source systems, the next crucial step is data transformation. This process is essential to ensure that the data meets the requirements of the data warehouse and is ready for analysis and reporting. Data transformation involves various operations, including cleaning, filtering, aggregating, and integrating the extracted data.

Here are some common data transformation techniques:

1. Data Cleaning:
- Data cleaning involves identifying and rectifying errors, inconsistencies, and duplicates present in the extracted data.
- This step is vital for maintaining data quality and integrity within the data warehouse.
- Common cleaning tasks include eliminating invalid or missing values, standardizing data formats, and resolving conflicts that may arise from different data sources.
2. Data Filtering:
- Data filtering focuses on selecting and extracting only the relevant subset of data from the extracted dataset.
- This process serves the dual purpose of reducing data volume and enhancing the efficiency of the data loading process.
- Filtering criteria can be based on specific attributes, time periods, or other pertinent factors, ensuring that only valuable data is retained for further analysis.
3. Data Aggregation:
- Data aggregation involves summarizing or consolidating the extracted data to a higher level of granularity.
- This step is particularly useful for reducing data volume and enhancing query performance within the data warehouse.
- Aggregation operations can include functions like sum, average, count, or max/min, allowing for the presentation of data in a more concise and meaningful format.
4. Data Integration:
- Data integration is the process of combining and merging data from multiple sources into a unified format.
- This step becomes necessary when the data warehouse needs to integrate data from various systems or departments within an organization.
- Successful integration ensures that the data is harmonized and can be used cohesively for analytical purposes.

Here’s an example of data transformation using Python: **import** pandas **as** pd

- *Load the extracted data into a DataFrame* df = pd.read\_csv('extracted\_data.csv')
- *Data cleaning*

  df.dropna(inplace=True)  *# Remove rows with missing values* df['date'] = pd.to\_datetime(df['date'])  *# Convert date column to datetime format*

- *Data filtering*

filtered\_df = df[(df['sales'] > 1000) & (df['date'] >= '2023-01-01')]

- *Data aggregation*

aggregated\_df = filtered\_df.groupby(['product', 'region']).agg({

'sales': 'sum',

'quantity': 'sum'

})

- *Data integration*

integrated\_df = pd.merge(aggregated\_df, product\_master\_df, on='product')

- *Save the transformed data to a new file* integrated\_df.to\_csv('transformed\_data.csv', index=False)

  In this example, the extracted data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. Data cleaning is 

  performed by removing rows with missing values and converting the date column to the appropriate datetime format. Data filtering is applied to select only rows where sales are greater than 1000 and the date is on or after January 1, 2023.

  Data aggregation is achieved using the groupby function to calculate the sum of sales and quantity for each product and region combination. Finally, data integration is performed by merging the aggregated data with a product master DataFrame based on the product column.

  *Loading Data into the Data Warehouse*

  After the data is extracted and transformed, it is ready to be loaded into the data warehouse. The loading process involves inserting the transformed data into the appropriate tables or structures in the data warehouse.

  There are several loading methods, including:

1. Batch Loading:
- Batch loading involves loading a large volume of data in batches or groups.
- This method is suitable for scenarios where the data can be processed offline or during non-peak hours.
- Batch loading is efficient for handling large datasets but may introduce a delay between data extraction and availability in the data warehouse.
2. Trickle Loading:
- Trickle loading involves continuously loading small amounts of data in real-time or near real-time.
- This method is useful when the data needs to be available immediately or when the data volume is relatively small.
- Trickle loading ensures a more up-to-date data warehouse but may require additional resources to handle the continuous data flow.
3. Real-time Loading:
- Real-time loading involves loading data as soon as it becomes available in the source systems.
- This method is suitable for scenarios where the data needs to be analyzed or reported in real-time.
- Real-time loading requires a robust and efficient data integration and loading infrastructure to handle the continuous data flow.
- It is especially beneficial in industries such as finance, telecommunications, and online retail, where up-to-the-second data is crucial for decision-making and staying competitive.

Here’s an example of loading transformed data into a data warehouse using SQL:

*-- Create the target table in the data warehouse* **CREATE** **TABLE** sales\_fact (

`    `product\_key INT,

`    `region\_key INT,

`    `date\_key INT,

`    `sales DECIMAL(10, 2),

`    `quantity INT

);

*-- Load the transformed data into the target table*

**INSERT** **INTO** sales\_fact (product\_key, region\_key, date\_key, sales, quantity)

**SELECT** p.product\_key, r.region\_key, d.date\_key, t.sales, t.quantity **FROM** transformed\_data t

**JOIN** product\_dim p **ON** t.product = p.product\_name

**JOIN** region\_dim r **ON** t.region = r.region\_name

**JOIN** date\_dim d **ON** t.date = d.date;

In this example, a target table named sales\_fact is created in the data warehouse to store 

the sales data. The transformed data is then loaded into the target table using an INSERT INTO statement.

The transformed data is joined with the dimension tables (product\_dim, region\_dim, and date\_dim) based on the respective attributes to retrieve the corresponding surrogate keys. The surrogate keys are used to establish the relationships between the fact table and the dimension tables in the data warehouse.

*Data Quality Considerations*

Data quality is a critical aspect of the data loading process. Poor data quality can lead to inaccurate analysis, unreliable reports, and incorrect business decisions. It is essential to ensure data quality throughout the entire data loading process, from extraction to loading.

Here are some key data quality considerations:

1. Data Accuracy:
- Data accuracy refers to the correctness and precision of the data.
- It is important to validate and verify the extracted and transformed data to ensure its accuracy.
- Data accuracy can be improved through data cleansing, validation rules, and data profiling techniques.
2. Data Completeness:
- Data completeness refers to the presence of all required data elements in the data warehouse.
- It is crucial to ensure that all relevant data is extracted and loaded into the data warehouse.
- Data completeness can be achieved through data profiling, data validation, and data reconciliation techniques.
3. Data Consistency:
- Data consistency refers to the uniformity and coherence of the data across different sources and systems.
- It is important to reconcile and resolve any inconsistencies or conflicts in the extracted and transformed data.
- Data consistency can be ensured through data integration, data mapping, and data reconciliation techniques.
4. Data Timeliness:
- Data timeliness refers to the currency and freshness of the data in the data warehouse.
- It is important to minimize the delay between data extraction and loading to ensure timely availability of data for analysis and reporting.
- Data timeliness can be improved through real-time or near real-time loading methods.
5. Data Validity:
- Data validity refers to the conformity and adherence of the data to predefined rules and constraints.
- It is important to validate and enforce data integrity rules during the data loading process.
- Data validity can be ensured through data validation, data profiling, and data quality monitoring techniques.

Here’s an example of implementing data quality checks using Python: **import** pandas **as** pd

- *Load the transformed data into a DataFrame* df = pd.read\_csv('transformed\_data.csv')
- *Check for missing values* missing\_values = df.isnull().sum() print("Missing values:") print(missing\_values)
- *Check for duplicate records*

  duplicate\_records = df.duplicated().sum() print(f"Number of duplicate records: {duplicate\_records}")

- *Check for data consistency*

region\_codes = ['NA', 'EU', 'APAC']

invalid\_regions = df[~df['region'].isin(region\_codes)] print("Invalid region codes:")

print(invalid\_regions)

- *Check for data validity*

invalid\_dates = df[pd.to\_datetime(df['date'], errors='coerce').isnull()] print("Invalid date values:")

print(invalid\_dates)

In this example, the transformed data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. Several data quality checks are performed:

- Missing values are identified by counting the number of null values in each column.
- Duplicate records are detected using the duplicated() function.
- Data consistency is checked by verifying that the region codes are valid based on a predefined list.
- Data validity is checked by attempting to convert the date column to a datetime format and identifying any invalid date values.

The results of these data quality checks are printed, allowing for the identification and resolution of any data quality issues before loading the data into the data warehouse.

*ETL vs. ELT*

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) are two approaches to the data loading process in data warehousing. The main difference between the two approaches lies in the order of the transformation step.

ETL Approach: - In the ETL approach, data is first extracted from the source systems, then transformed to meet the requirements of the data warehouse, and finally loaded into the data warehouse. - The transformation step occurs before the data is loaded into the data warehouse. - ETL is suitable for scenarios where data transformation is complex and resource-intensive. - ETL allows for data cleansing, integration, and restructuring before loading, ensuring that the data is in the desired format and quality. - However, ETL can be slower and less scalable compared to ELT, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.

ELT Approach: - In the ELT approach, data is first extracted from the source systems and loaded into the data warehouse without significant transformation. - The transformation step occurs within the data warehouse, typically using SQL or other query languages. - ELT is suitable for scenarios where data transformation can be efficiently performed within the data warehouse. - ELT allows for faster loading of raw data into the data warehouse, enabling quicker access to the data for analysis. - However, ELT may require more storage space in the data warehouse to accommodate the raw data, and the transformation process may put additional load on the 

data warehouse infrastructure.

The choice between ETL and ELT depends on various factors, including the complexity of data transformation, the volume of data, the available resources, and the specific requirements of the data warehouse.

Here’s an example of an ETL process using Python and SQL: **import** pandas **as** pd

**from** sqlalchemy **import** create\_engine

- *Extract data from source systems* source\_data = pd.read\_csv('source\_data.csv')
- *Transform data*

  transformed\_data = source\_data.rename(columns={'old\_name': 'new\_name'})

  transformed\_data['created\_date'] = pd.to\_datetime(transformed\_data['created\_date'])

  transformed\_data = transformed\_data[transformed\_data['sales'] > 0]

- *Load data into the data warehouse*

engine = create\_engine('postgresql://user:password@host/database') transformed\_data.to\_sql('sales\_fact', engine, if\_exists='append', index=False)

In this example, the ETL process is implemented using Python and SQL. The source data is extracted from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. The data is then transformed by renaming columns, converting the created\_date column to a datetime format, and filtering out rows with non-positive sales values.

Finally, the transformed data is loaded into the data warehouse using SQLAlchemy to connect to a PostgreSQL database. The to\_sql() function is used to load the data into the 

sales\_fact table, with the if\_exists parameter set to ‘append’ to add the data to the existing table.

Here’s an example of an ELT process using SQL: *-- Extract data from source systems*

**CREATE** **TABLE** raw\_sales\_data **AS**

**SELECT** \*

**FROM** source\_database.sales;

*-- Load data into the data warehouse* **CREATE** **TABLE** sales\_fact **AS SELECT** \*

**FROM** raw\_sales\_data;

*-- Transform data within the data warehouse*

**UPDATE** sales\_fact

**SET** created\_date = TO\_DATE(created\_date, 'YYYY-MM-DD');

**DELETE** **FROM** sales\_fact **WHERE** sales <= 0;

In this example, the ELT process is implemented using SQL. The source data is extracted from a source database table into a new table called raw\_sales\_data in the data warehouse. The 

data is then loaded into the sales\_fact table without any transformations.

The transformation step is performed within the data warehouse using SQL statements. The created\_date column is converted to a date format using the TO\_DATE() function, and rows with non-positive sales values are deleted using a DELETE statement.

*Extraction, Cleaning, and Storage Techniques for Business Data*

Extracting, cleaning, and storing business data is a crucial aspect of the data loading process in data warehousing. It involves retrieving data from various source systems, ensuring its quality and consistency, and loading it into the data warehouse for analysis and reporting. Let’s explore each of these techniques in more detail.

1. Data Extraction:
- Data extraction is the process of retrieving data from source systems, such as transactional databases, CRM systems, or flat files.
- There are different approaches to data extraction, including full extraction, incremental extraction, and change data capture (CDC).
- Full extraction involves extracting the entire dataset from the source system, while incremental extraction focuses on extracting only the changes or updates since the last extraction.
- CDC captures and extracts data changes in real-time or near real-time, enabling up-to-date data in the data warehouse.
- Extraction techniques may involve using SQL queries, APIs, or specialized ETL tools to retrieve the data from the source systems.
2. Data Cleaning:
   1. Data cleaning, also known as data cleansing or data scrubbing, is the process of identifying and correcting inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistent data.
   1. It involves various techniques to ensure data quality, such as data profiling, data validation, data standardization, data deduplication, and data enrichment.
   1. Data profiling helps in analyzing the data to identify patterns, anomalies, and quality issues.
   1. Data validation checks the data against predefined rules or constraints to identify invalid or inconsistent values.
   1. Data standardization converts data into a consistent format, such as standardizing date formats or address structures.
   1. Data deduplication identifies and removes duplicate records or merges them into a single record.
   1. Data enrichment enhances the data with additional information from external sources to improve its completeness and accuracy.
   1. Data cleaning is essential to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of the data in the data warehouse, enabling accurate analysis and decision-making.
3. Data Storage:
   1. Data storage involves loading and storing the extracted and cleaned data in the data warehouse.
   1. The storage techniques used in data warehousing are designed to optimize query performance and support efficient data retrieval.
   1. Common storage techniques include relational databases, columnar databases, data partitioning, data compression, and data indexing.
   1. Relational databases store data in tables and schemas, providing a structured and widely used approach to data storage.
- Columnar databases store data in a columnar format, optimizing query performance for analytical workloads.
- Data partitioning involves splitting large tables into smaller, more manageable partitions based on certain criteria, such as date ranges or geographic regions.
- Data compression reduces the storage footprint and improves query performance by applying compression techniques to the data.
- Data indexing creates additional data structures to speed up data retrieval and query execution.
- The choice of storage techniques depends on factors such as data volume, query patterns, and performance requirements.

Here’s an example of extracting, cleaning, and storing business data using Python and SQL: **import** pandas **as** pd

**from** sqlalchemy **import** create\_engine

- *Extract data from source systems*

source\_data = pd.read\_csv('source\_data.csv')

- *Data cleaning*
- *Remove rows with missing values* cleaned\_data = source\_data.dropna()
- *Standardize date format*

cleaned\_data['date'] = pd.to\_datetime(cleaned\_data['date'], format='%Y-%m-%d')

- *Deduplicate data*

cleaned\_data = cleaned\_data.drop\_duplicates(subset=['id'])

- *Data enrichment*

enriched\_data = pd.merge(cleaned\_data, external\_data, on='key')

- *Store data in the data warehouse*

engine = create\_engine('postgresql://user:password@host/database') enriched\_data.to\_sql('fact\_table', engine, if\_exists='replace', index=False)

In this example, the data is extracted from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. Data cleaning techniques are applied, such as removing rows with missing values, standardizing the date format, and deduplicating the data based on the ‘id’ column.

Data enrichment is performed by merging the cleaned data with an external dataset based on a common key. This step enhances the data with additional information from the external source.

Finally, the enriched data is stored in the data warehouse using SQLAlchemy to connect to a PostgreSQL database. The to\_sql() function is used to load the data into the fact\_table, with the if\_exists parameter set to ‘replace’ to overwrite any existing data in the table.

Here’s an example of creating partitions and indexes in SQL to optimize data storage and retrieval:

*-- Create partitions based on date ranges* **CREATE** **TABLE** sales\_fact\_partitioned (

**id** INT,

date DATE,

`    `product\_id INT,

`    `sales DECIMAL(10, 2)

)

**PARTITION** **BY** **RANGE** (date);

**CREATE** **TABLE** sales\_fact\_2022\_01 

**FOR** **VALUES** **FROM** ('2022-01-01'

**CREATE** **TABLE** sales\_fact\_2022\_02 

**FOR** **VALUES** **FROM** ('2022-02-01'

**PARTITION** **OF** sales\_fact\_partitioned

) **TO** ('2022-02-01');

**PARTITION** **OF** sales\_fact\_partitioned

) **TO** ('2022-03-01');

*-- Create indexes on frequently accessed columns*

**CREATE** **INDEX** idx\_sales\_fact\_date **ON** sales\_fact\_partitioned (date); **CREATE** **INDEX** idx\_sales\_fact\_product\_id **ON** sales\_fact\_partitioned (product\_id);

In this example, partitions are created for the sales\_fact\_partitioned table based on date ranges. The table is partitioned by the date column, and separate partition tables (sales\_fact\_2022\_01 and sales\_fact\_2022\_02) are created for each month.

Indexes are created on the date and product\_id columns to speed up query performance. These indexes help in quickly locating and retrieving specific data records without scanning the entire table.

Extracting, cleaning, and storing business data is an iterative process that requires close collaboration between data engineers, data analysts, and business stakeholders. It involves understanding the data requirements, defining data quality rules, and establishing data governance practices to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the data in the data warehouse.

By applying effective extraction, cleaning, and storage techniques, organizations can ensure that their data warehouse contains high-quality, reliable data that can be used for accurate analysis, reporting, and decision-making.

**Content of the Lesson** *OLAP Cubes*

OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) cubes are multidimensional structures that allow for efficient data analysis. They form the core of most OLAP systems and provide a way to organize and summarize large amounts of data into a format that is easy to understand and navigate.

An OLAP cube is a data structure that consists of measures and dimensions. Measures are the quantitative values that are being analyzed, such as sales revenue or units sold. Dimensions are the attributes or characteristics that provide context to the measures, such as time, product, or location.

The cube metaphor comes from the fact that an OLAP cube can be visualized as a multidimensional cube, with each dimension representing a different aspect of the data. For example, a sales cube might have dimensions for time, product, and location, with the measures being sales revenue and units sold.

OLAP cubes allow users to perform various analytical operations, such as slicing and dicing the data, drilling down to more detailed levels, or rolling up to higher levels of aggregation. These operations enable users to explore the data from different perspectives and gain insights into patterns, trends, and anomalies.

Here’s an example of a simple OLAP cube in Python using the pandas library:
